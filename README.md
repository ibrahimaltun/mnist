# Repository Description

This repository is about the LeNet architecture and its usage on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale handwritten digits, and the goal is to develop a neural network model to recognize these digits. The LeNet architecture is considered a pioneer in convolutional neural networks, and this repository provides a guide to implementing this architecture and using it to recognize digits in the MNIST dataset.
